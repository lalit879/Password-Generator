# üîí React Password Generator

A secure and user-friendly password generator built with **React** and styled with **Tailwind CSS**. This application allows users to create strong, customizable passwords and copy them to the clipboard with a single click. It's a practical demonstration of fundamental and advanced React hooks like `useState`, `useCallback`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`.

## üí° Core Concepts Demonstrated

This project is an excellent example of several key React concepts:

-   **`useState`**: Manages the state for password length, character inclusion options (numbers, special characters), and the final generated password.
-   **`useCallback`**: Optimizes performance by memoizing the `passwordGenerator` and `copyPasswordToClipboard` functions, ensuring they are not recreated on every render unless their dependencies change.
-   **`useEffect`**: Triggers the `passwordGenerator` function whenever the length, number, or character inclusion settings are modified by the user, creating a reactive experience.
-   **`useRef`**: Creates a reference to the password `input` element, allowing the `copyPasswordToClipboard` function to select the text for a better user experience upon copying.
